# Saturn

Saturn is a web development framework written in F# which implements the server-side MVC pattern. It works on top of Microsoft's [ASP.NET Core](https://www.asp.net/core/overview/aspnet-vnext) and provides very good integration with other ASP.NET Core components. 
Many of its components and concepts will seem familiar to those of us with experience of other web frameworks like Ruby on Rails or Python’s Django.

It's heavily inspired by Elixir's [Phoenix](http://phoenixframework.org/).
